# Welcome to Mockupless

Mockupless is a design methodology that explores how code can be an effective and easy to pick up tool for interaction designers. It is aimed at smoothing the learning curve and providing tools and techniques that allow you to write simple code that is friendly to alterations.

Prototyping brings thoughtfulness to the design workflow by enabling testing, deeper analysis and productive iterations. *Prototyping with code* allows you to test your ideas early, iterate and keep testing throughout the whole design process.

Check out the introductory courses that teach the basics of the Mockupless approach to prototyping:

Also, take a look at the prototypes inspired by Mockupless:

## Technologies

Mockupless is built around web technologies. HTML, CSS and JavaScript are at the core, but some modern frameworks and tools play the crucial role in shaping the methodology:

- Flexbox and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) are used to quickly create layouts that are easy to alter.
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is used to add interactivity with the smoothest learning curve and minimum effort.
- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) is used to create, preview and share prototypes, all in one place.

## Beta

The Mockupless website is currently in beta. Here this pseudoscientific term means that with all the effort, passion and editing that’s been put into the website, it’s not complete and may contain some embarrassing mistakes. If you encounter one, please be patient and if you have a minute, send an email to [poorbeta@mockupless.com](poorbeta@mockupless.com).

This website is designed to constantly improve and evolve, and neither of these causes can be achieved without help from the community. Feel free to address you concerns, ask questions and seek help in the [Gerenal channel](https://spectrum.chat/mockupless/general) of the [Mockupless Spectrum Forum](https://spectrum.chat/mockupless).
