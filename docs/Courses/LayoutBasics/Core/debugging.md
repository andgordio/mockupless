# Debugging

Sometimes you need to inspect your code. Usually because you create a layout and styling with something in mind but it doesn't come out as you expected. 

Maybe this is due to a bug and you need to come back to your code and look for bugs, and sometimes you need to look how the actual implementation work.

## Typos

Missing quotation marks, closing tags, etc.

Best way to avoid is not make them by being careful with your syntax and check it as you write it.

At first it feels like a burden, but if you make a habit of it, it becomes a routine and start doing it automatically without noticing.

## Inspector

Class overrides.

Analyze someone else's code or one you created a while ago.
