<!-- todo: illustration: welcoming to interaction -->

Welcome to Interaction basics! In this course you will start learning to create truly interactive and testable prototypes with the the power of JavaScript and Vue.js. You will start small and finish the course creating your own multi-page prototype with dynamic components and collections that respond to users' actions.

## What you'll learn

This course teaches you the basic concepts of creating prototypes with JavaScript and Vue:

- **Storing and changing data**. A shift from static layouts to interactive prototypes starts with saving all the content you want to become dynamic in special containers — variables.

- **Saving users' input**. Learn to store data from all kinds of form controls and use it in your prototypes. 

- **Reacting to clicks** and some other users' actions. Learn to create instructions for what should happen in response to users’ actions.

- **Showing and hiding UI elements**. Display elements, components and pages on demand with the help of conditions.

- **Displaying dynamic lists and grids**. Learn how to create a collection of components from a single container and a special data container — array.

In end of the course you will use a set of sketches and assumptions to create an interactive multi-page prototype.

## Prerequisites / Requirements

This course doesn't require prior knowledge of JavaScript or other programming languages. If you have experience with coding, some concepts will be familiar to you and you may learn at a faster pace. Yet going through all articles of the course is recommended to understand the mockupless approach which sometimes differs from the way programming is usually tought.
<!-- todo: link: maybe to About section where approach is described and reasoning is provided -->

Knowledge of the [Layout basics](./../LayoutBasics/) is required to understand HTML and CSS code used in the examples so you can focus solely on interactivity.

<!-- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) are used in this course to view and edit prototypes. You are free to use Firefox and a code editor of your choice instead—just make sure you are familiar with their UI so you won't spend too much time finding required functionality. -->

[CodePen](https://codepen.io) is used in this course to create and preview prototypes. Create an account if you haven’t already—it’s free.

<!-- the Practice bit probably should be replaced with Practice artice -->

<!-- ## Practice

Most articles in this course have self-practice tasks that are designed to help you learn the material better by applying the knowledge yourself. Completing these tasks is highly recommended as it is almost impossible to understand most of the concepts without practicing them and combining them to solve complex tasks. Facing problems and finding your way out is the key to mastering new skills.  -->

## Community

Together with creating a knowledge base, Mockupless is aimed to build an open community of designers who share ideas, struggles and desire to create better digital products. Visit [General](https://spectrum.chat/mockupless/general) Spectrum channel to discuss core prototyping concepts. Go to [Interaction basics](https://spectrum.chat/mockupless/interactions-basics) channel to ask question about this course, provide help to others and share your progress.

Please, be kind and patient.
