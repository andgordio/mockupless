<!-- todo: illustration: welcoming to interaction -->

Welcome to Interaction basics! In this course you will start learning how to create truly interactive and testable prototypes with the power of JavaScript and Vue.js. You will start small and finish the course creating your own multi-page prototype with dynamic components and collections that respond to users’ actions.

## What you’ll learn

This course teaches you the basic concepts of creating prototypes with JavaScript and Vue:

- **Storing and changing data**. A shift from static layouts to interactive prototypes starts with saving all the content, that you want to become dynamic, in special containers called variables.

- **Saving users’ input**. Learn to store data from all kinds of form controls and use it in your prototypes. 

- **Reacting to clicks** and some other users’ actions. Learn to create instructions for what should happen in response to users’ actions.

- **Showing and hiding UI elements**. Display elements, components and pages on demand with the help of conditions.

- **Displaying dynamic lists and grids**. Learn how to create a collection of components from a single container and a special data container called array.

## Prerequisites / Requirements

This course doesn't require prior knowledge of JavaScript or other programming languages. If you have experience with coding, some concepts will be familiar to you and you may learn at a faster pace. Yet going through all articles of the course is recommended to understand the mockupless approach which sometimes differs from the way programming is usually taught.

Knowledge of the [Layout basics](./../LayoutBasics/) is required to understand HTML and CSS code used in the examples. This way you will be able to focus solely on interactivity.

[CodePen](https://codepen.io) is used in this course to create and preview prototypes. Create an account if you haven’t already—it’s free.

## Community

Together with creating a knowledge base, Mockupless is aimed to build an open community of designers who share ideas, struggles and desire to create better digital products.
