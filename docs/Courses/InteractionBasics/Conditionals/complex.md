# Complex conditions

<!-- todo: MAYBE remove this article from this course: a little too complex. The only time it is used later is Objects Pro self-practice task-->

## Multiple conditions ‚Äî AND

Quite often checking for a single condition is not enough. Let's say your prototype has two kinds of welcome screens ‚Äî each for a role users choose when signing up:

![lo-fi wireframes of three screens: Sign up and 2 different welcome screens](./images/condition-complex-wireframes-1.png)

Here's a rough userflow for this case:

![flowchart diagram with two conditions and 3 screens](./images/condition-complex-chart-1.png)

First, you check whether users are logged in. If they are, you check for their role to show one welcome screen to shoppers and another one to merchants. You can implement this by creating two variables and two layers of conditional containers:

```vue
<div v-if="!isUserLoggedIn">
  Sign up screen
</div>
<div v-if="isUserLoggedIn">
  <div v-if="userRole === 'shopper'">
    Welcome, shopper
  </div>
  <div v-if="userRole === 'merchant'">
    Welcome, merchant
  </div>
</div>
```
<!-- ```js
data: {
  isUserLoggedIn: false,
  userRole: 'shopper'
}
``` -->

This works fine, but you can avoid nesting containers by combining conditions. When you turn the flowchart into a flat list of conditions for each screen, it's easy to see which conditions should be combined for each container:

![flat diagram with list of conditions for each of 3 screens](./images/condition-complex-chart-2.png)

You can combine two conditions, that **both** have to be satisfied, with **AND** operator written as **&&:**

<!-- In our example you need to check whether two conditions are satisfied for welcome screens, use AND written as &&: -->

```html
<div v-if="!isUserLoggedIn">
  Sign up
</div>
<div v-if="isUserLoggedIn && userRole === 'shopper'">
  Welcome, shopper
</div>
<div v-if="isUserLoggedIn && userRole === 'merchant'">
  Welcome, merchant
</div>
```
#### üëê Hands-on

1. Download the [sample file](./../../../course-files/interaction-basics/conditionals-complex-and-1.html.zip) and open it in Chrome.
2. Use radio buttons on Sign up screen to switch roles. See value changing in dev tools.
3. Switch authentication state between `true` and `false` in Vue dev tools to see different welcome screens.

## Either of conditions ‚Äî OR

In some cases you want an element to be rendered if **either** of two conditions is met, not both of them. Take a look at a very basic onboarding with pagination:

![3 onboarding screens with Previous and Next buttons](./images/condition-complex-wireframes-2.png)

Notice that ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button, for example, appears on the first and the second screens. So the condition to display this button would be if the current page is first or second. To perform this type of check use **OR** operator written as **||**:

```html
<button v-if="currentPage === 1 || currentPage === 2">
  Next
</button>
```

This condition can be read as ‚Äúshow the container if `currentPage` equals to 1 OR if `currentPage` equals to 2‚Äù. Now when either of those conditions is satisfied, the container will be rendered. 

:::tip Good eye
If you take your time with [inequality](./equality.md#inequality) you might suggest that `currentPage === 1 || currentPage === 2` can be written simply as `currentPage !== 3`, and you'd be absolutely correct. Sometimes there's more than one approach to defining conditions.

#### üëê Hands-on

1. Download the [sample file](./../../../course-files/interaction-basics/conditionals-complex-or-1.html.zip) and open it in Chrome.
2. Select Root in devtools and click - / + in to change the value of currentPage and see the appropriate containers being shown and hidden.
3. Open the file in VSCode and see the structure used to achieve the result.

## Combining conditions

Conditions for rendering UI elements can become quite complex and rely on more than two variables. For example, you have a universal navigation bar in your application. You need a button that is shown only to users from either Admin or Super-admin groups and only on Users screen:

![a single screen requesting user's full name and short bio](./images/condition-complex-wireframes-3.png)

You can combine as many conditions as you want, but you need to keep in mind that different operators have different [precedence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#Table). For example this code will not produce the expected results:

<!-- This means that your conditions won't be read by browser simply from left to right, but checking for equality, for example, will be performed before OR operators. This code will not produce expected results: -->

```html
<button v-if="role === 'admin' || role === 'superadmin' && screen === 'users'">
  Add
</button>
```

Since AND operator has higher precedence than OR, for admins the button will be rendered on all screens:
- `userRole === 'superadmin' && currentScreen === 'users'` will be executed first and result in false
- then `userRole === 'admin' || false` will result in true no matter what value currentScreen has.
 <!-- `userRole === 'superadmin' && currentScreen === 'users'` will be executed first and the button will be rendered for admins on all screens. -->

You can use **parenthasis** to control the order of operations, because groupping has the highest precedence and an operation inside group will be always performed first. 

```html
<button v-if="(role === 'admin' || role === 'superadmin') && screen === 'users'">
  Add
</button>
```

## Self-practice

### Part I

Create a prototype with 3 views: Events list, Event creation and Introduction modal view.

![todo:description](./images/condition-task-wireframes-1.png)

The workflow for this prototype is the following:

1. When users are not creating a new event, they see the Events list.
2. When new uses are creating a new event, they see an Introduction view.
3. When users who have already seen an Introduction view are creating a new event, they see Event creation view

Here's a userflow for the logic described above:

![todo:description](./images/condition-task-chart-1.png)

Create 3 containers (one for each view), 2 variables (one for each condition) and apply proper conditions to containers to implement the suggested workflow. Don't forget to use Vue devtools in Chrome to check your results.

### Part II

![todo:description](./images/condition-task-wireframes-2.png)

Instead of having 2 top navigation headers ‚Äî one in Events list and one in Event creation view ‚Äî create a universal header with following conditions:

- The container itself is shown if the users are not creating a new event, or if users who have already seen an Introduction view are creating a new event
- Create button is shown only if users are not creating a new event
- Cancel and Save buttons are shown only if users are creating an event
- The title of the screen changes from ‚ÄòEvents‚Äô to ‚ÄòNew event‚Äô when users are creating an event
