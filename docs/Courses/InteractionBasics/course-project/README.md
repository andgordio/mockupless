# The task

Congratulations on making it to the final task of the course!

If the Interaction basics were your first experience with programming your head must feel a little heavy from all new concepts you have learned. Also, itâ€™s fine if you donâ€™t feel confident about being able to apply your new knowledge properly. This is a natural process of learning new thingsâ€”you start overwhelmed and confused but with practice you gain confidence and clarity. Embrace this course project, see how far your skills can take you, and feel the joy of creating experiences you could only imagine before. 

### The prototype

Create a lo-fi prototype of an app for placing reservations at local restaurants:

The prototype allows to view a list of restaurants, see their details, place and cancel reservations, view and manage favorites.

Play with the prototype above and try recreating it yourself from scratch. If you want to test a different layout or even change the workflow slightly feel free to give it a try. Remember, the whole point of creating interactive prototypes is being able to test, validate, analyze and iterate over the designs. 

If you encounter problems while working on this project, read the following articles. They provide a step-by-step guide to creating the core structure of the prototype.
