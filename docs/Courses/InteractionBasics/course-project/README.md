# The task

Congratulations on making it to the final task of the course! If the Interaction basics was your first experience with programming your head must feel a little too heavy from all the new concepts you learnt. This is fine if you have very little confidence in being able to apply your new knowledge properly. This is a natural process of learning new things—you start overwhelmed and confused, but with practice you gain confidence and clarity. Embrace this project, see how far your skills can take you, and feel the joy of creating experiences you could only imagine (or animate) before. 

## The prototype

Create a lo-fi prototype of an app for placing reservations at local restaurants:

<iframe height="720" style="width: 100%;" scrolling="no" title="Interaction basics—Course project" src="//codepen.io/andgordy/embed/oOGbjj/?height=720&theme-id=36403&default-tab=result" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">

  (<a href='https://codepen.io/andgordy'>@andgordy</a>) on <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

The prototype allows to view a list of restaurants, go their details page, place, view and cancel reservations, view favorites and add to them.

<!-- Design an simplistic online shopping experience with a catalog and chaeckout process:

![5 screens with catalog and checkout process](./media/course-project-1.png)

1. **Catalog**. List of products.
2. **Product**. Item details with ability to add item to the cart.
3. **Cart**. List of items a user added to the cart and the Checkout button.
4. **Checkout**. A basic form to collect information from a user.
5. **Confirmation** of user's information.


## Catalog

![a catalog and item details screens](./media/course-project-2.png)

- 5-10 items in a catalog is enough for core prototype.
- Both pages have quick access to Cart page.
- Pressing “Add to cart” button makes an item appear in the cart. The button changes style to “Added”


## Checkout

![cart, checkout and confirmation screens](./media/course-project-3.png)

- “Close” buttons returns a user to a page where they pressed the Cart button: either Catalog or Product
- Country code in Checkout form changes to match the selected country.  -->
