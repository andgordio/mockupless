- title: ⚡️ Learn fast, code faster
  details: It takes a lot to become a software engineer, but you don’t need to be one to create prototypes. Engineers create secure, fast and accessible apps, and designers create prototypes that mimic the experiences. This difference means that you need to learn less and will code faster.
- title: ✨ Test everything
  details: Design is a never-ending process of making assumptions and validating them. Prototyping with code allows to you test ideas early and keep testing them at every stage of the design process. This means that you can build your designs on educated decisions, not guesses.
- title: 💫  Shoot for the stars
  details: Creating something with code means there are no limits to how far you can take your designs. Every wireframe you sketch in code can become a high-fidelity prototype with complex interactions, analytics, a database, a dynamic design system, and any imaginable integration.
